            <p>Hello there! <br><br>
            I'm Marell Bito, but you can call me Bitto! I'm currently a third-year student at UTS studying games development, <br>
            with a major in Interaction Design. <br><br>

            I am a great team player, known for my skills in game design and development. Over the past 2 years, <br>
            I have worked on a good amount of well-crafted projects, both by myself; as well as with a team of amazing people. <br><br>

            This website serves to show off what I have done, portfolio style. I hope you can find enjoyment in my projects! <br><br>

            Below are buttons that will take you to either my Github, Linkedin, or my itch.io account. Check them out! :D <br><br>

            Quick but important note, I recommend checking the 'Projects/Skills' tab found on the navigation bar above. It has projects<br>
            from various subjects and events, each with a little explanation about them! As well, it shows off the effective skillset <br>
            that I have! <br><br>

            Have fun there, and thank you for checking me out! :)<br></p>
