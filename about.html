            <p>Hello there! <br><br>
            I'm Marell Bito, but you can call me Bitto! I'm currently a student at UTS studying games development. <br><br>
            I am a great team player, known for my skills in game design and development. Over the past 2 years, <br>
            I have worked on a good amount of well-crafted projects, both by myself; as well as with a team of <br>
            amazing people. <br><br>
            This website serves to show off what I have done in my time. I hope you can find enjoyment in my projects! <br><br>
            Below are buttons that will take you to either my Github, and my Linkedin account. Check them out! :D <br><br>
            As mentioned before, I recommend checking the 'Projects' tab found on the navigation bar above. It has projects<br>
            from various subjects and events, each with a little explanation about them! Have fun there, and thank you! </p>
