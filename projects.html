                    I learnt it for my Introduction to Computer Graphics subject.
                    There are two projects which were highlights during this subject. <br><br>
                    The first is an <a href="shaders.html" target="_blank">implementation of shaders using a planet in space.</a>  You can rotate the planet as it spins; as well as change the parameters of the atmosphere!<br><br>
                    The second is our final group project, which was a <a href="https://radiantinferno.github.io/cavegen/" target="_blank">generated Cave Exploration game.</a> It used the marching cubes algorithm to generate the terrain. I contributed through implementing the movement and design of the overall project! :D

                <p class="image_description">Unreal Engine, more specifically Unreal Engine 4, is a game engine I only recently learnt for Advanced Games Programming, a subject I did.
                    However, my experience with the engine quickly grew as I used it. As it's a high-level game engine with flexibility, I grew to like UE4. <br><br>
                    The main project I completed during the subject was creating a procedurally generating room system based on layering different parts of a room node. 
                    You can watch the video for it <a href="https://youtu.be/IX5ACWPKRqw" target="_blank">here</a> for a more in-depth look into the system! :)

                    The unique mechanic with Duck Duality are the 'Modules'. You are shown a 'Module' after the end of each room, which gives you a buff and nerf. You can choose to either take the module or keep your current ones, with a maximum of three modules. <br><br>
                    I contributed with the general game design and level design of the game, as well as creating the concept of the game. You can download and play it <a href="https://bittoboi.itch.io/duck-duality" target="_blank">here.</a>

                    I contributed in the main design and marketing for the project; as well as helping to introduce the game's concepts alongside my friend, Jade Barton, at the start of development. <br><br>

                    The game is a mystery solving game that involves you solving cases by talking to humans, as well as Spirits! :O <br><br>
                    With the challenge of making a game that you can complete in approximately 20-30 minutes, this is a massive achievement of a project in my eyes! :D<br><br>
                    You can play it <a href="https://bittoboi.itch.io/detectivegame" target="_blank">here</a>, where I contributed in the level and game design; as well as programming and Itch.io design. :)

                    The game is a top-down rogue-lite where your health is your currency. Steal health from your enemies by attacking, and use that health to buy upgrades. But be careful, the enemies can steal health back from you! <br><br>
                    It was an absolute honour to work on this game, especially with it being the first project where we developed it akin to how games are developed within the industry.<br><br>
                    My main roles were SCRUM Master, project management, and design/concept, however I did also assist with programming and other aspects alongside the team. <br><br>

                    However, in 2023 I am now contributing as part of PDT's Steering Committee. Working alongside other students and Jaime Garcia, we are helping to continue PDT in order to give students the opportunity to build their portfolios and skills.<br><br>
                    Before 2023, it ran throughout a whole year. But now, it is every semester. This drastic change needed a Steering Committee, to which I am supporting. :)<br><br>
