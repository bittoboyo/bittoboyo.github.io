                    I learnt it for my Introduction to Computer Graphics subject.
                    There are two projects which were highlights during this subject. <br><br>
                    The first is an <a href="shaders.html" target="_blank">implementation of shaders using a planet in space.</a>  You can rotate the planet as it spins; as well as change the parameters of the atmosphere!<br><br>
                    The second is our final group project, which was a <a href="https://radiantinferno.github.io/cavegen/" target="_blank">generated Cave Exploration game.</a> It used the marching cubes algorithm to generate the terrain. I contributed through implementing the movement and design of the overall project! :D

                I know how to program in C# as a result, and I am familiar with Unity on a general standpoint! :) <br><br>
                Most projects found here have been made with Unity, it will show if they are or not! :D

                <p class="image_description">Unreal Engine, more specifically Unreal Engine 4, is a game engine I only recently learnt for Advanced Games Programming, a subject I did.
                    However, my experience with the engine quickly grew as I used it. As it's a high-level game engine with flexibility, I grew to like UE4. <br><br>
                    The main project I completed during the subject was creating a procedurally generating room system based on layering different parts of a room node. 
                    You can watch the video for it <a href="https://youtu.be/IX5ACWPKRqw" target="_blank">here</a> for a more in-depth look into the system! :)

                <p class="image_description">This game was developed as a part of a week-long game jam held after Introduction to Computer Games Development. You control SQU3AKY in this 2D rogue-like platformer through different levels! :) <br><br>
                    The unique mechanic with Duck Duality are the 'Modules'. You are shown a 'Module' after the end of each room, which gives you a buff and nerf. You can choose to either take the module or keep your current ones, with a maximum of three modules. <br><br>
                    I contributed with the general game design and level design of the game, as well as creating the concept of the game. You can download and play it <a href="https://bittoboi.itch.io/duck-duality" target="_blank">here.</a>

                <p class="image_description">A game developed as part of 2022's Playmakers Dev Team, you control Schnoz Swanson and sneeze around in this platforming puzzle game! <br><br>
                    I contributed in the main design and marketing for the project; as well as helping to introduce the game's concepts alongside my friend, Jade Barton, at the start of development. <br><br>
                    The game can be downloaded <a href="https://playmakersdevteam.itch.io/nose-of-a-thousand-winds" target="_blank">here</a>, with full controller support available! :)

                <p class="image_description">This was our final group project for Introduction to Computer Game Design. It was also selected to be presented at the <a href="https://showcase.gamesstudio.org/autumn-2022/" target="_blank">2022 UTS Games Showcase!</a><br><br>
                    The game is a mystery solving game that involves you solving cases by talking to humans, as well as Spirits! :O <br><br>
                    With the challenge of making a game that you can complete in approximately 20-30 minutes, this is a massive achievement of a project in my eyes! :D<br><br>
                    You can play it <a href="https://bittoboi.itch.io/detectivegame" target="_blank">here</a>, where I contributed in the level and game design; as well as programming and Itch.io design. :)
