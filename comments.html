        <h1>Reflection on Overall Design of Website:</h1>
        <p>
        For the website, I wanted to employ the same colour palette as seen with my avatar throughout the website's use of images. With all of the CSS, the text incorporated easy-to-read
        text in the form of black text in a fairly consistent font size to give the website flair; but still keep it easy-to-read. I wanted the website to show a more playful side of my personality rather than 
        just viewing the website as a basic 'Learn More about Me'; incorporating jokes to my text and using emojis to show a more fun side of my computing past, future goals, and more.
        Furthermore, I wanted the website to still have a sleek look to it; taking the form of the simple but bold black navigation bar on the top of each page and the hero image
        of my avatar on the index page with bold gold text to further follow the theme of the website.

        <h1>Technical Aspects of Website:</h1>
        <p>
        Regarding the technical aspects of my website, it has incorporated numerous techniques that I have learnt from my avid study into developing a functional website in this subject.  I ensured that the HTML code is organised so that not only can I understand what 
        does what; but so can others who may read the code. Furthermore, all of the names for the number of CSS selectors utilised in the development of the website have a distinct name in relation to their intended purpose/context (eg. The CSS ID’s ‘#bittotwitch, #bittotwitter, and 
        #bittoyoutube have names pertaining to the images that have a link anchored to their respective links like the 'bittoyoutube' image taking the user to my Youtube channel).
        </p>
        <p>
        I ensured to utilise different CSS selectors within my website to facilitate my personal understanding on HTML/CSS web development. CSS tags were included, such as ‘html’ and ‘body’ for establishing the height, margin, font style as well as the background colour of the entire website. 
        Furthermore, I mainly utilised CSS ID’s and CSS classes with the development of the website as a result of their effective organisation. CSS ID’s were used for a specific element of the webpage (eg. All the titles for the various webpages excluding the headers for comments, even including the three layers of text on the index page’s hero image, using CSS ID’s). 
        CSS classes were used for when I wanted to change the style of a given group of HTML elements for the website to allow for convenience as it would be both unorganised and inefficient to have a number of unnecessary ID’s when a class could be used (eg. The creation of the navigation bar is under ‘.navigation’ in the CSS external stylesheet of my website, with it branching to ‘ul’, ‘li’, ‘li a’, and ‘li a: hover’
        so that I could successfully create a stylish navigation bar that has a transition when the mouse hovers over each option).

    <div class="aesthetics">
        <h1>Aesthetics of Website:</h1>
        <p>
            When users view my website, they should perceive my various webpages as something that has been purposefully designed to engage the user not only through the content provided (there is less information, and it is more obscure than what I imagined it to be due to privacy issues) but also through the unique page design I wanted to consistently employ throughout the website.
            However, although I wanted the webpage to be unique, I still followed the usual conventions of web design when creating my website. This can be seen using graphics in the form of the hero image provided in the index page, where although it is still following the convention of following the theme of my whole webpage it still engages the user with the bold text 
            on the front stating who I am (name changed for privacy), what I do and what the user can do. 
            It provides users with a clear understanding of what they can do and where they can find it, something that is required when having effective site structure and content on my website.
        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, I also aimed to ensure that the material on my webpage is accessible from laptops, desktop PC’s and mobile devices as I implemented HTML code on the header of each HTML page for the webpage that ensures that the 
            width of the device viewing the webpage will change the width of the webpage respectively, ensuring a smooth look that makes it highly accessible and appropriate for all devices. 
        </p>
        <p>
            All decision-making that was employed when developing my website ensured that the webpage would not only be responsive to the user, but also evoke a sense of good design and thought-out planning to ensure the user can not only understand the content but come to appreciate it. 
            This can be seen through my use of various styles of displaying information expanding from only using paragraphs of text. This includes images with anchor links to their respective link in the ‘Future Goals’ webpage, the use of a table to show information about my hobbies in a unique way in the ‘Computing Past’ webpage, and the 
            concurrent use of a stylish navigation bar that transitions from white-text black-background to black-text white-background when the user hovers their mouse over the specific tab.
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore, with the development of my website I wanted users to perceive my webpages with fun and interest but still be able to understand the content through my consistent persistence to following the webpage standards portrayed throughout the Internet.
        </p>

    <div class="accessibility">
        <h1>Accessibility Aspects of Website:</h1>
        <p>
            I have been able to develop my website to also be accessible to users who may have 
            disabilities throughout different changes made on the website that improve the accessibility of my website in general.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the most prominent ways I have achieved this can include the effective use of equivalent alternative text for images so that users who are blind and rely on a screen reader can still understand the 
            content of the website (eg. The images for my different social links all have a respective alt-text added to their HTML elements in line with their corresponding link).
        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, on top of using clear fonts and the use of logical headings and lists to provide meaning and structure to the website, I have also implemented ways of not fully relying on colour for specific terms written on my website. 
            As users may be colour-blind, they will not notice some word highlights/change in colour to enhance comprehension (eg. The word ‘However’ in the ‘Computing Past’ webpage is highlighted in red to emphasise how although I may have a lack of experience with computing, I still aspire to get into games development). 
            Therefore I also underlined those words in order for colour-blind users to still recognise the enhancement of comprehension I am trying to convey in my content (eg. The words ‘Twitch’, ‘Youtube’ and ‘Twitter’ have a similar CSS style on them, however the background colour evokes the same effect as to underlining the word).
